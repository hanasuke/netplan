      to care since we're /restarting/ the service to load the new config.
    - Fix the autostart package to be more sensible: we don't really care if
      networkd autostarts or not, but we need to make sure that our generator
      will run at boot, so instead check the state, but only assert it once
      we've added a config file and before checking the state of our dummy
      device.

      as reliable as possible; by setting saner defaults.

  * src/nm.c: set the MTU even though we also specify it in systemd-networkd

    otherwise default to the wrong value.
  * src/networkd.c: Set IPv6AcceptRA=no anytime we don't do DHCPv6 (or by the

    the cases where unconfigured devices still get an IPv6 address.
    (LP: #1655440)

    configured; this follows the same logic as setting IPv6AcceptRA=no in

    it does, an unconfigured device for IPv6 will truly be left with no config.

  * Support /run/netplan/*.yaml files.
    This is useful if you want to try out a new network config before
    "committing" it to /etc: if your remote server is still reachable after
    "apply", you copy the files to /etc; otherwise rebooting will go back to
    the known-good state.
  * If global renderer is set to NM, allow NM to manage all devices.
    By default, NetworkManager only manages wifi and wwan devices (via
    /usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d/10-globally-managed-devices.conf). If
    global renderer is set to NetworkManager, disable that file in /run so
    that NM will once again manage all devices. This should be configured on
